Describe your method used to recognize the unknown actions here.

Start with training a different model for each of the training actions.
Using the EM method to train an HMM.
Same as the case for RecognizeActions.m

Then test for each action, by computing likelihood over each of the models.
We compute the likelihood by constructing a clique tree consisting of three types of factors.
The initial state prior, the transition CPDs and the emission CPDs.
Calibrating this clique tree yields the likelihood from the unormalized beliefs after message passing is completed.

We then choose the model with highest likelihood, and state that as our prediction.
