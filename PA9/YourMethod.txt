Describe your method used to recognize the unknown actions here.

Start with training a different model for each of the training actions.
Using the EM method to train an HMM.
Same as the case for RecognizeActions.m

Then test for each action, by computing likelihood over each of the models.
Choose the model with highest likelihood.
